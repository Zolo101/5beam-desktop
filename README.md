# 5beam-qt
Desktop application that allows you to play 5b levels from the 5beam database to your flash player.

## Building
I've used Visual Studio 2019 to build this.

## Notes
**It is greatly recommended that you put 5beam in a folder before starting for the first time.**

**For any bugs, please start an issue in the issue tab (or contact me on discord)**. 

If you want to play the last played level file, just press "Play 5b".
